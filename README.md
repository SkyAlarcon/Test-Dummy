# Welcome to Baby Wolf's Test Dummy

## What is this

The test dummy is a repository to contain any kind of testing code to make sure
interactions occurs the intended way or simply know what an interaction will do.

Most test are commented with an opening statement of what will be tested and another
statement to share results, either if it was conclusive or not or if I actually
understood what happened.

## What we have

### Fetch #1
Basic ```fetch()``` tests with **node v18** to start programming API's linked to
another API's

Results: ```fetch()``` on **node v18** is too unstable and will not be used yet.
Found an library (axios) that to the same objective, but it's way more reliable.
Also experimented a bit with *Steam API* to start developing something


### Database Test
Few database tests with MongoDB to explore further how to retrieve information
and understand if I can use others DB's unique ID as my unique ID or if I need
to create my own
